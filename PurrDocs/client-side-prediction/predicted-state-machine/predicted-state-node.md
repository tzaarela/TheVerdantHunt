# Predicted State Node

A predicted state node is a class you can inherit from in order to build your own states for the [predicted state machine](./).

There are multiple predicted state node types to inherit from:

* `PredictedStateNode<STATE>` This allows your statenode to hold and simulate state
* `PredictedStateNode<INPUT, STATE>` This allows your statenode to hold and simulate state w. input. Optimal for characters/players'

### Overrides

These can override a few different methods, in order for you to run functionality unique to the individual states:

* `Enter` This is optimal for running simulation logic upon entering the state
* `Exit` This is optimal for running simulation logic upon exiting the state
* `StateSimulate` This is your per‑tick state simulation; runs only when this state is active
* `ViewEnter` Run view/visual logic upon entering the state (predicted or verified)
* `ViewExit` Run view/visual logic upon exiting the state (predicted or verified)

Mind you, you still have the normal predicted identity override as well!

### Snippet

```csharp
public class AttackState : PredictedStateNode<MyInput, MyState>
{
    public override void Enter() { /* start attack windup */ }

    protected override void StateSimulate(in MyInput i, ref MyState s, float dt)
    {
        // simulate attack timing using only s and i
        s.attackTimer = Mathf.Max(0, s.attackTimer - dt);
        if (s.attackTimer == 0) machine.SetState(nextState);
    }

    public override void ViewEnter(bool verified)
    { /* play VFX/SFX, camera shake, etc */ }
}
```
